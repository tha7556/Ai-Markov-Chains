Come warm your hands on hellfire and brimstone
Empty the pockets of the innocent victim
Bound by fear
We misplace trust
In your voice
Inside these walls
Convincing us we have no choice
Gaze upon these stare of naivete
Two thousand years replaced
With eighteen inches of our faith
Bound by fear
We misplace trust
In your voice
Inside these walls
Convincing us we have no choice
And this reflection
On where the message lies
Stained glass and marble
Or somewhere deep inside
(somewhere deep inside)
This message you will only find deep inside
To read these words
You keep looking down
But in the sky
This message is written in the clouds
