With your eyes
Glazed and half-smiled
Explain to me the details
Of your God-given right

You point your finger
In my face but
You can't remember what
You did last night

It's all fun and games 'til
You try to justify,
It's all well and done 'til
You question the choices in your life

Join all the millions
Of victims who prescribe
To this mediocre life
And all these years
Have been lost looking for something
That you'll never find

It's all fun and games 'til
You try to justify,
It's all well and done 'til
You question the choices in your life
