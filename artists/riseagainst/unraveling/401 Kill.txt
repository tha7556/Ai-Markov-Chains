As I watch your life go up in flames,
You'll swear up and down you'd like to change
But when the sun sinks slowly into the sky,
Now you're right
Where you started again with nothing to say,
Without an argument or case
And when it's said and done and done and said,
And now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes, inside your eyes

When will you stop and realize,
The worth and value of your life?
As you suffocate yourself within this mindless,
9-5 wake up! there's more!
And your life is nobody's but yours
And now its said and done and done and said,
And now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes

You're running circles around my slow pace
You've reached the finish line only to realize there was no race
I'm sick of being stepped on for the things I choose
I give and take and now I've taken all I could

And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could (now I've taken, now I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could (now I've taken, now I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could
