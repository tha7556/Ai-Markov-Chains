(Gethsemane!)

It was the perfect night
Then you had to go and ruin it with a kiss now
I'm trapped inside here
The innocence we held once so carelessly
Has been suffocated in this breathless moment

[Chorus:]
Believe in me and I will believe in you
You're asking of me everything
So I'll give it all to you

With arms raised to the stars begging them to listen
With legs littered with scars cut from these olive branches
Now, point of return now crossed and our hands left shaking
Tonight we give in to temptation

[Chorus:]
Believe in me and I will believe in you
You're asking of me everything
So I'll give it all to you

Someone stop my mind from screaming
It's so loud I can't hear myself think
Life, Death, Religion, Survival
It makes no sense
Never try to tell me that I'm a coincidence

[Chorus:]
Believe in me and I will believe in you
You're asking of me everything
So I'll give it all to you

And I don't
Believe in you
Never safe from you [?]
Believe in me
You're asking of me everything
So I'll give it all to you

And if I never have you, then I can never lose you
Now, everything here is a lie
Where is the truth?
Where is the fucking truth?
