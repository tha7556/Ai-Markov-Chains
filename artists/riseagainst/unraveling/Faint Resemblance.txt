Wait,
I'm not listening to you now
I wasn't listening to you then
I know that nothing will be the same again
There's only so much I can handle
Only so much I can take
Before my knees start to buckle
And my arms start to shake

Have we been here before?
Will we be here again?
I don't know how much more of me you expect

Standing here right now
And I beg for you to let go
I dread the day you finally do
And I fight for your attention
Too little too late or too much too soon
And how will this plague the time
We share from here on out
And how long will this taint
All these words spilling from my mouth

Have we been here before?
Will we be here again?
I don't know how much more of me you expect

Standing here right now
Standing here right now
I'm standing!

And have we been here before?
Will we be here again?
I don't know how much more of me you expect
