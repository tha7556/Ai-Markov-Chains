It's all the same thing
Now that it ever was
Except now you've strayed too far
Need you to stop digging your hole
And follow the path we light
Don't need an invitation to be reconciled
'cause these home fires are burning
Stare into your empty eyes and wonder...
"How could something so right (woah oh) turn out so wrong?"
You spent your time making excuses
For the ways of life that you are choosing
"How could something so right (woah oh) turn out so wrong?"
Not sure exactly where I am

The more we organize
We suck out this life that serves as the fuel behind
You wanna take the passion in my veins
And put it down in black & white
You've got your foot directly on the gas
I watch you burn out so fast
Now I can see just what you've become
And "How could something so right (woah oh) turn out so wrong?"
I don't have a backup plan
This is all that I am
And "How could something so right (woah oh) turn out so wrong?"
Not sure exactly where I am

(One!) one thousand
(Good!) intentions
(Lost!) translation
(Lost!) forever

(One!) one thousand
(Good!) intentions
(Lost!) translation
(Lost!) forever lost

"How could something so right (woah oh) turn out so wrong?"
I don't have a backup plan
This is all that I am
And "How could something so right (woah oh) turn out so wrong?"
Not sure exactly where I am
Where I am
