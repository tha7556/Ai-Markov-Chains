Aside from the name that holds us together
Now I think we'd fall apart
It's the years we'll pretend we've forgotten
That separate our hearts
And I don't remember the way this was
But the pictures prove I knew you once
And where is the source of our mistakes
I'm afraid one day we'll drift so far
We'll wake up not knowing where we are
These words accomplish nothing if I'm gone
