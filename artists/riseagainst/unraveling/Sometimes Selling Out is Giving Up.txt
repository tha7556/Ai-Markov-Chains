Trying to make a difference
But where the fuck did you go wrong?
Lying to all the names and faces
That have been there all along
How can you ask me to just forget?
All the sick lines
And the words you said
How can you ask me to just forget?
Deny the promises you've made
The things you said
That you hold dear
Behind your empty words
You hide and wait
Until that you fall in the clear
How can you ask me to just forget?
All the sick lines
And the words you said
How can you ask me to just forget?
Just don't ask me to just forget
