Speak with hesitation
Talk with reservation
Blood on your hands dried long since
But guilt still glowing in your eyes

You hide behind
(and now this blood has long since dried)
Your perfect crime
(guilt still glowing in your eyes)
Never ask why you lie

Now I've watched you

Stack the mistakes you've made on top
Of the lies to hide them
Your excuses just don't add up
Empty handed we all wonder why

You hide behind
(and now this blood has long since dried)
Your perfect crime
(guilt still glowing in your eyes)
Never ask why you lie

Now I know that
Your words
Your actions
Intentions all were lies
Your heart grows heavier with time
(and now this blood has long since dried!)
Have I said enough
Have I said too much
Is it your responsibility to decide
You're heart grows heavier with time
(I will decide!)
And I fell victim to the changing tide
And this blood has long since dried
This blood has long since dried
