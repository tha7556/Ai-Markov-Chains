Ooh, I wanna be in the picture on the postcard
Pouring pitchers in the backyard by the garden we tend.
Ooh, I wanna be where the crickets chirp for me
Frogs that fractal at my feet
By the dirt road dead end.
Where the matches burn like candles, no locks on the doors
We can blow the seeds of dandelions, wish for nothing more
Where the sunrise comes early, but the night’s still plenty long
And the constellations mirror glistening dewdrops on the lawn
I feel the grass between my toes already.

Ooh, I wanna be, in a place I can call a place to get away from it all.

Ooh I wanna be, in the autumn pastel landscape
An odd, attractive escape on the outskirts of town
Ooh I wanna be, where it’s always apple season
Underneath the dancing trees where we know up is down.
Where the television’s broken and the campfire’s smoking
And we’re hopeful for tomorrow cause we know we had today.
We’re laughing and we’re joking with no criticism spoken
If the clouds come out and drown the town we’ll still go out and play
I feel the hands that I can hold already.

Ooh, I wanna be, in a place I can call a place to get away from it all.

I know the day is far away, and if it comes it will not stay.
But I can’t chase the flavor from my mind.
Well this is my lysergide daydream. It’s not a plan, not half a scheme
To find the lake to bathe my two bare feet.

Ooh, I wanna be, in a place I can call a place to get away from it all.
Ooh, I wanna be, in a place I can call a place to get away from it.
