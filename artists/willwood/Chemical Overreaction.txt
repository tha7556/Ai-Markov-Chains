Nettles on my saddle and a badge on my vest, better bet I’ll never settle and I never could rest.
Till the sunrise dies and sets in the west, a rattlesnake bite and a bullet in my chest.
I won’t stop to drop to draw a line in the sand, ‘cause I’ll be picked apart to pieces by coyotes, I’m a lizard in the hand of the medicine man who is the wizard of the land on wild peyote.
Woah.
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, I’m gaining traction.
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, I’m taking action.
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, no more distractions.
I’m done relaxing. I am a chemical reaction.
Bienvenidos a la villa de arañas españas, where the sentimental value of the city around you is deleted obsolete and still completely will stun you, I’m tripping like a klutz and I’m rolling like thunder.
I’m a snot nosed pothead playing with matches, a rotten spot of mold with my hands on a cactus. My mouth is dry and my eyes are red, I’m chewing on sand ‘cause the desert’s in my head.
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, I’m gaining traction.
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, I’m taking action.
Aye aye, I eye my eyes, no more distractions.
I’m done relaxing. I am a chemical reaction.
Wretch and pule this panoramic, stretched out view is fat with panic.
Precognition lacks in hindsight, we caught the illness back before the twilight.
I might be a saint worth steeples, I might be the brain of evil.
Bad things happen to good people, good things happen to me.
