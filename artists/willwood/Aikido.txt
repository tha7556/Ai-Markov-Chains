I apologize for playing with your eyes, but I’m obsessed with you.
Rolling out of bed is morning in my head, ‘cause I’m obsessed with you.
Rose mirages into vases, I don’t stand a chance.
Quiet girls with wrist corsages, cordial silence, I can’t dance.
Holding breath by graveyards, salt over my shoulder, I’m obsessed with you.
Rainbow-walking cave-heart never will be bolder, I’m obsessed with you.
Chickenscratch Rembrandts of your likeness, all this nonsense makes me think.
My insides cry “try thy finest” why, then, am I at my brink?

I told Doctor Tillis to prescribe an illness, but he said his schedules filled with
Children who need Prozac, Prilosec and Lo-jack, triple-sec and Lexapro
For second-guesses. Drugs that heal. So we can touch instead of feel.

Oh, I apologize for playing with your eyes, but I’m obsessed with you.
Bite your tongue and smile, stick around a while. I’m obsessed with you.
Neurotic erotic, neurotic erotic, neurotic erotic, neurotic erotic,
I’m obsessed with you.
