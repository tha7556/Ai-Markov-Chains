Night sky, I wonder why I am alive until I die.
I find that at this size, no answer can be right.
All the moments you’ve lost, all the money it cost, all the dreams that you tossed aside.
All that you feel is only real if you decide it inside.
So when you’re holding on to everything but you feel you cannot, let it go, cause everything is a lot.


WE ARE BODDHISATVA, WE ARE BUDDHA, DYING, WAKING UP
AS BUTTERFLIES WHO FALL ASLEEP AS MAHAPRAJNAPARAMITA
WE CUT DOWN OUR BODDHI TREES, BURN DALAI LAMA AS A WITCH
FROM SHANGRI-LA TO AUSCHWITZ, BE BARTER, KARMA IS A BITCH
GLORY BE SATORI BU ITS HALLUCINATORY AND ITS SURE TO BE A
STORY WE CAN TELL IN PURGATORY
WE SAW IT ONCE ON MESCALINE, ENLIGHTENMENT IS BORING
ALL YOUR HEROES REINCARNATED, THE GRATEFUL DEAD IS TOURING.
LAO TZU, CHUANG TZU, YIN-YANG TATTOOS, FUCK YOUR MYSTIC WISDOM, FIND YOUR OWN WAY HOME FROM BONNAROO.
IT'S JUST ONE MORE RELIGION, FUCK YOUR VISIONS, WE'VE DONE ACID TOO.

DESTROY TO ENJOY, DESTROY TO ENJOY, DESTROY TO ENJOY, DESTROY TO ENJOY.
