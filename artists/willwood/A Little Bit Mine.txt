Say you’re still her
The woman you were
And you haven’t turned into
Someone who never could love me again
Cause you never broke my heart, no, you fixed it, and now it works.
But only enough just to suffer the hurt.
What can I say to convince you to slip back into my arms again?
I won’t do you no harm again, lemme tell you that I’m sorry and that-

I’m just a little bit crazy about you.
Just a little bit out of my mind.
Just a little insane without you
Please come back and be just a little bit mine.

I never thought, and if I did, I forgot
While blackout in-love
That’s what’s only starting would come to an end.
But now I’m hungover and hung out to dry and I’m giving it time.
Does not knowing the truth turn my words into lies?
What can I say to convince you or do to make you agree with me?
I don’t need you to be with me- just try to remember what you’d see in me.

I’m just a little bit crazy about you.
Just a little bit out of my mind.
Just a little insane without you
Please come back and be just a little bit mine.

I’ll be here singing until our heartbeats fall into that rhythm again
Whether it is or isn’t the end; who cares?
God knows that I could use a friend.

I’m just a little bit crazy about you.
Just a little bit out of my mind.
Just a little insane without you
Please come back and be just a little bit mine.
