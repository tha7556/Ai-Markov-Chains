Salt on the glass, coke on the knife
Is there anything left to escape but life?
I didn’t sign. I didn’t sign up for this.
May today lose what yesterday won.
Hope that tomorrow I’ll get something done.
I’m gonna run. I’m gonna run out of time.

But, I’ll tell you what, I’m not afraid to die.
I’m more afraid of what might happen first.
Either way it’s not like we’ll get out alive.
I can’t say that I know which one is worse.

Everything’s useless, especially songs
I think the truth is that everyone’s wrong.
Still sing along. Still sing a long, long time.
I might keep looking for nothing to find.
They say “Keep trucking, it’s all in your mind!”
“Jimmy, you’re fine,” End of the line gaining speed.
Wrapping trees.

But, I’ll tell you what, I’m not afraid to die.
I’m more afraid of what might happen first.
Either way it’s not like we’ll get out alive.
I can’t say that I know which one is worse.
