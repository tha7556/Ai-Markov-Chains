She’s got the eyes of a snake- loaded dice- raising stakes from a cash cow.
I’ll be her burn victim- hypothermic- so damn hot.
Come to smiling like I blacked out in Glasgow
I woke up in the name that I wore last night to the sound of an empty bed.
And it’s ringing in my ears just like sweet nothings from the voices in my head.

Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord. Don’t ask me what I mean.
Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord. Just say that it’s on me.

She’s got the touch of an anesthesiologist- please put me under.
Because I tremble with the notion that there’s something unsaid
But numb my head I’ll mumble reticently I wonder how I
I woke up in the middle of my surgery and I watched them botch my heart
Only the second worst thing that I could’ve thought was
“This won’t have to end if it doesn’t start.”

Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord. Don’t ask me what I mean.
Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord. Just say that it’s on me.

I’ll never know. I’ll never know. I’ll never know. I’ll never know what it’s like.
What it’s like to love you.
I’ll never know. I’ll never know. I’ll never know. I’ll never know what it’s like.
What it’s like to love you.

Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord. Heart blue-er than my balls.
Where do you get off being so God damn beautiful?
Oh lord. Just say that it’s on me.
