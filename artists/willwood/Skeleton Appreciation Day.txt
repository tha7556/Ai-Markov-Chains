To cut down on my silhouette, my favorite food are smoke and hearts.
My leftover frets forget stiletto-self vendettas, while my cracking backbone lacks but backs up my false starts.
All nightmares start as dreams and I hear my subconscious screaming.
They say that beauty’s just skin deep, so naturally, please show me your-

Bones, bones, bones
Let me see your bones
Well I don’t wanna know if the feeling follows home.
Bones, bones, bones
Hell, we’re all alone

All love starts as a scheme, so wake me up, I’m tired of sleeping.
They say that beauty’s just skin deep. So rip it off and please show me your

Bones, bones, bones
Let me see your bones
Well I don’t wanna know if the feeling follows home.
Bones, bones, bones
Hell, we’re all alone
If I come home, baby, will you show your bones?

Let me see your bones
Well I don’t wanna know if the feeling follows home.
Bones, bones, bones
Hell, we’re all alone
If I come home, baby, will you show your bones?

Bones, bones, bones
I can see my bones
Well I don’t wanna know if the feeling follows home.
Bones, bones, bones
Hell, we’re all alone
If I come home, baby will you see my bones?
