Twin Glock, bitch you ain't a thug, you ain't in gen pop
Red [?], I'ma keep on stompin' 'till his neck pop
Feds rock, I can't be caught slippin' so the feds hot
Red drop, I quit poppin' sticks and sippin' red drop
Twin Glock, bitch you ain't a thug, you ain't in gen pop
Red [?], I'ma keep on stompin' 'till his neck pop
Feds rock, I can't be caught slippin' so the feds hot
Red drop, I quit poppin' sticks and sippin' red drop

AR pistol, ooh I love how it hold Glock clips
Ass shot, let that thotty twerk bitch, we can't lock lips
First things first, I'ma trapper I can't come second
Bitch you better go and get your first, I'm [?] any second
Leglock, I'ma throw lil shorty in a leglock
Headshot, ain't got cash on deck I'm throwin' headshots
Bread rock, millis in the dirt, I think I'm El Chap
Oh, keep a Glock, 4 O's, 10 milli, big hoes
Free my Uncle Carto, gave him six in Mexico
He gon' keep his chin up, God be watchin' on his soul
[?] out in Texas doin' five for trappin' bows
I'm still 'bout my paper, who got work for the low?
Got more percs than a store, got more drank than the doc
Used to sippin' cut, I'm mixin' Tech with the Wock
You claimin' you's gang, but why you actin' like a cop?
If I see the paper workin', I'm gon put two in yo neck

Twin Glock, bitch you ain't a thug, you ain't in gen pop
Red [?], I'ma keep on stompin' 'till his neck pop
Feds rock, I can't be caught slippin' so the feds hot
Red drop, I quit poppin' sticks and sippin' red drop
Twin Glock, bitch you ain't a thug, you ain't in gen pop
Red [?], I'ma keep on stompin' 'till his neck pop
Feds rock, I can't be caught slippin' so the feds hot
Red drop, I quit poppin' sticks and sippin' red drop
