Stompin' off the blunt with my Gucci kicks
You a fuckboy, yeah you new to this
She gon' bust it wide for a big thug Shakewell
Doin' coke with a lil' slut
But I stopped poppin' sticks and I stopped chewin' percs
Stopped sippin' drank, now my stomach yeah it hurt
Still beat the pack, and I be flippin' all the work
Shameless gang the movement, I'ma leave 'em in the dirt

You don't want no funk, you a lil' bitch
Still sellin' fake 'cause I'm shameless
Lost a couple homies to the fentanyl
That was just last month and I miss 'em all
I remember poppin' sticks walkin' in the mall
Never with no shop, call me Mr. need to cop it all
Still reppin' they can never colour code
Bout a hunnid bands, 5 songs up in my catalogue
Think my girlfriend hate me 'cause I got 'em all designer
All she ever wanted was them snakes and them tigers
She gon' hit me up when she done with nine to five'in
Kick her to the curb, I'm the one who put the time in

Stompin' off the blunt with my Gucci kicks
You a fuckboy, yeah you new to this
She gon' bust it wide for a big thug Shakewell
Doin' coke with a lil' slut
But I stopped poppin' sticks and I stopped chewin' percs
Stopped sippin' drank, now my stomach yeah it hurt
Still beat the pack, and I be flippin' all the work
Shameless gang the movement, I'ma leave 'em in the dirt

Please don't go lil' shawty, yeah I need you
Shit, I was talkin', know I'm aimin' to deceive you
She was fuckin' with me back when I was havin' seizures
Now I'm doin' better, she say Shaker I'ma leave you
I don't really get it bitch, but same time I don't give a fuck
Young bipolar from the benzos I was poppin' up
Take her on vacation now I think I'd rather double up
Big juice in my double cup, sober, now I'ma fuck it up

Think she really mad 'cause I'm drippin' in my diamonds
Who you know can mix Ralph Lauren with designer
Drop a couple tabs, tappin' yak and now I'm fryin'
40 filled with hollows, you don't really wanna try it

Stompin' off the blunt with my Gucci kicks
You a fuckboy, yeah you new to this
She gon' bust it wide for a big thug Shakewell
Doin' coke with a lil' slut
But I stopped poppin' sticks and I stopped chewin' percs
Stopped sippin' drank, now my stomach yeah it hurt
Still beat the pack, and I be flippin' all the work
Shameless gang the movement, I'ma leave 'em in the dirt
