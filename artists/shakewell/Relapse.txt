Big drank, big syrup, lil' soda
Full tank, five bitches, Range Rover
Got these full clips, 30 stick, 30s [?], I'm so shameless
Money gang takeover
Big drank, big syrup, lil' soda
Keep a full tank, five bitches, Range Rover
Got these full clips, 30 stick, 30s [?], I'm so shameless
Money gang takeover

Gotta make this bread, might not see tomorrow
I'm so shameless, put that shit on my coffin
I'm so painless, all the pills I be poppin'
Watch me lane switch, too basic, need a model
I'm impatient, think I need to see my doctor
I'm a patient, he [?] when I'm walkin'
Really hate this, said I'm puttin' down the bottle
But that drank hits, 'specially when I mix it with the narcos
[?] drugs, had to copy moonwalkin'
Spent 30 bands, and just too much just on my coffin
I can't sip that, unless you pourin' up the Wock
And yeah I said that, I was sober, now I'm off it

Big drank, big syrup, lil' soda
Full tank, five bitches, Range Rover
Got these full clips, 30 stick, 30s [?], I'm so shameless
Money gang takeover
Big drank, big syrup, lil' soda
Keep a full tank, five bitches, Range Rover
Got these full clips, 30 stick, 30s [?], I'm so shameless
