MTM, hit 'em with the heat
Big Juice Tha Sip

Bitch I get the pack and I serve it
Popped too many benzo's now I think I'm start to swervin'
Walk to his face make a fuck boy nervous
Watch what you claim shooters strapped up like some turban
Bitch I get the pack and I serve it
Popped too many benzo's now I think I'm start to swervin'
Walk to his face make a fuck boy nervous
Watch what you claim shooters strapped up like some turban

I've been choppin cane, rain, hell, sleet and snow
I been powder talking with my cousin Mexico
If you talking kilos while we talking on the phone
Come meet me in person if you need a couple zones
Stainless steel get the pack fuck you talkin' bout?
Come and creep up on a kid hoe, we can thump it out
Keep a choppa with it Dick when I'm posted on the coach
Side piece thick and she sloppy when she suck it out
Why the fools still tryin to sign me bitch independent
I'mma go and cop a hunnid pack and It won't make it end
Split it with my people you call Migos we gone run it up
Opps still salty cause we winning bitch I'm booted up

Bitch I get the pack and I serve it
Popped too many benzo's now I think I'm start to swervin'
Walk to his face make a fuck boy nervous
Watch what you claim shooters strapped up like some turban
Bitch I get the pack and I serve it
Popped too many benzo's now I think I'm start to swervin'
Walk to his face make a fuck boy nervous
Watch what you claim shooters strapped up like some turban
