Nine times out of ten they do that same shit
Workin' for the weekend, I'm workin' for a spaceship
Ten out of ten, they on that lame shit
Shoot 'em in they mouth and do that lane switch
(Aye yo Lil Mexico, pass the gas!)

[Shakewell:]
Only blue strips, you a basic ass rapper
Ten, twenty, fifty, hunnids, I'm a real life trapper
Real life loonie losin' it, I'm havin' a crisis
Whole clique strapped up, bitch we lookin' like ISIS
30 deep when I step, bitch you don't wanna fight us
It's just me myself and I, a 30 clip and a rifle
Fuck a friend, bitch good, like to suck on my Eiffel
Call me trapper of the century, I was born with the title
Nine times out of ten they do that same shit
Workin' for the weekend, I'm workin' for a spaceship
Ten out of ten, they on that lame shit
Shoot 'em in they mouth and do that lane switch
Tell me how that brain is, shawty, cause I need me a swallow
Count guap up on the jack, guess I'm feeling like Rollo
I could eat this 100 count and never wake up tomorrow
Fuck that shit, I ain't a bitch, I never fold on my partner
Ten toes, ten hoes, one show in each state
Ten shows, ten bands, each get, so what I make
Give a fuck, then do the math, cause I don't really care
I go triple in the trap, catch a milli in a year
Then the bullet graze his ear, put another in his chest
Had about ten meetings, still in them pants
Favorite rapper Foo Foo, I keep hunnid percent
I woke up still perc'd, hit the blunt and reset

Lost ten homies, how can I feel blessed
I'm just doin' what they want, man, runnin' to the check
Money can't buy no happiness they said, they ain't never take 20, dropped that on they neck
Lost ten homies, I cannot feel blessed
I'm just doin' what they want, man, runnin' to the check
Money can't buy no happiness they said, they ain't never take 20, dropped that on they neck

[Pouya:]
That Rollie on my wrist put a smile up on my face
That Ruger on my waist keep a fuckboy in his place
10K for the feature, and I just might up my rate
I hit a lick and do the race, it got me feelin' like Tay-K
I don't want yo pussy, rather buy some real estate
Swallow my dick but don't get inside my mind
Cause you won't get blown away
Baby bone, I got some issues
Momma told me if they kill me, they gon' miss me
So I'm out here dodgin' missles
Nine times out of ten they on that fuck shit
Pull up and hop out and pop the trunk quick
No Gucci gang, but you know I got that pump, bitch
I'm swervin' lanes, it may look like I'm rushin'
Get off that carpet, you don't want no static
Fully automatic, let you have it if you want it
Gettin' money was a habit
All my bitches was the baddest, all my shooters, they lil' savage
Hunnid thousand in the attic
IRS can never have it (yuh)
