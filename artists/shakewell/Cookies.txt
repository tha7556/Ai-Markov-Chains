Been pourin the Wock up, it all that I need
Lil shorty bad and conceited
Bitch I'm the plug, don't ask what I need
I pick the nugs out the tree
I keep a Glock in my handbag, ain't kick the cup, where my drank at?
Pack it up, I can ship it to you, be the bankerman, keep a dozen Rugers
[x2]

Say you need an eighth of the indoor
I just keep movin' ten packs of the outdoor
Why you keep askin' where the out for?
If you don't know don't know me don't call on my trap door
[?], bitch that's every week
Choppers 'gon play, then I let it scream
Spend my green hunnids, got blues on me
I need a plug on some good OG
Send me the play, [?]
I just hit a lick, four hunnid and I'm still lookin'
Hunnid on [?] and I'm still juggin'
Fam gotta eat, in the kitchen, so I'm still cookin'
[?], bitch that's every day
XD and Glock .40, let it spray
Kudos gon' run 'em down, broad day
Half [?] will travel, any state
I keep a plane on me, hate hills
Shameless money, movin' all them pain pills
I pop a 30, got pain still
Shooters hangin', bangin' out the windowsill
Don't say no name, if you do, you get shanked
Snitches and [?] hoes, shit that I hate
Hoes and them thots, that's that shit that I love
Slow walk in the bank, I be off all them drugs

Been pourin the Wock up, it all that I need
