Too stuck shorty, I be too stuck
Two blunts, all I need is two cups
If you feelin' some type, I can't ride with you
Only here for one night, let me vibe with you
Too stuck shorty, I be too stuck
Two blunts, all I need is two cups
If you feelin' some type, I can't ride with you
Only here for one night, let me vibe with you

Show me love shorty, now she hate me cause I'm trappin'
I ain't like them broke boys bitch, I had to make it happen
New crib, smokin' dank, flyer than Aladdin
Hunnid pack touchin' down, flip it, ain't no cappin'
Look you got a past and some exes, I don't give a fuck
You was rockin' with me since I was hoppin' off the bus
Independent, yeah she make her own bread too
I ain't never been the one to go and cuff a bitch
You be tellin' all these lies with you
Truth is baby, I'm just gettin' high with you
I can see the pain up in your eyes, it's true
Baby just come with me for a night or two, can't do it like I do

Too stuck shorty, I be too stuck
Two blunts, all I need is two cups
If you feelin' some type, I can't ride with you
Only here for one night, let me vibe with you
Too stuck shorty, I be too stuck
Two blunts, all I need is two cups
If you feelin' some type, I can't ride with you
Only here for one night, let me vibe with you
