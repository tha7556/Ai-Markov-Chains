Strauss spin galaxies
Planets circulate through Jack and Coke
Slaves to my drunken gravity, addicted to control
A toast to what's forgotten and what were tryin' to forget
She steps outside of her body and she lights a cigarette

Life's a kid who feels foolish for kisses she gives
Goin' quick cause her parents are listening in
And here I am, drinking again; just drinking again
Life's a kid who feels foolish for kisses she gives
Goin' quick cause her parents are listening in
And here I am, drinking again; just drinking again
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/power-drunk.html]

Get your reality away from, you're leaning in to close
Use the fire in my eyes to smoke the brains out of my skull
A toast for those forgotten and those we're tryin' to forget
Caught up in the moment huggin' threads inside the web

Life's a kid who feels foolish for kisses she gives
Goin' quick cause her parents are listening in
And here I am, drinking again; just drinking again
Life's a kid who feels foolish for kisses she gives
Goin' quick cause her parents are listening in
And here I am, drinking again; just drinking again
