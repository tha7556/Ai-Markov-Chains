Early mornin'
Before the kids get up for school
With her boyfriend
Sittin' in the living room

Daddy don't come around here no more
And Momma's cooking rocks up on the stove
Cooking rocks up on the stove

Early mornin'
Before the kids get out of bed
And her boyfriend
Been hangin' 'round again

Daddy don't come around here no more
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/kiss-the-cook.html]
And Momma's cooking rocks up on the stove
Cooking rocks up on the stove

A little bit of water, some baking soda
The milk's gone bad, the cup's tipped over
I'm not gonna do that when I get older
You kids'll just do what your momma told ya

A little bit of water, some baking soda
The milk's gone bad, the cup's tipped over
I'm not gonna do that when I get older
You kids'll just do what your momma told ya

Daddy don't come around here no more
And Momma's cooking rocks up on the stove
Cooking rocks up on the stove
