Clothes are hanging off the chair
Sliding down her underwear
Breaking skin, leaving marks
Fitting, refitting, sweaty and hot
She like to look like she don't care
Face all covered by her hair
"Romance is dead," she said... "Let's fuck"

My hands down her pants and we're back in the cab
And we push and we pull and we grab

Falling down, up the stairs
Let's go somewhere, anywhere
Slipping in, leaving marks
Forcing, submitting, sweaty and dark
Whisper heavy on my ear
Face all covered by her hair
"Romance is dead," she said... "Let's fuck"

Her hands down my pants and we're back in the booth
And we love and we hate and we use
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/romance-is-dead.html]

Who are you? When Nobody's watching
No judgment, no morals, no lies and no talkin'
Me and you. Fooling on top and
Bursting for something hungry and sloppy
Who are you? When nobody's watching
No judgment, no morals, no lies and no talkin'
Me and you. Fooling on top and
Lusting for something hungry and sloppy

Clothes are hanging off the chair
Let's go somewhere, anywhere
Breaking in, leaving marks
Forcing and fitting, sweaty and hot
She like to act like she don't care
Face all covered by her hair
"Romance is dead," she said... "Let's fuck"

My hands down her pants and we're back in the bed
And we laugh, and we fall, and she said...

"The romance is dead."
