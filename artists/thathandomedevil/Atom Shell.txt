(Spoken) Here are the thrill-seekers, corrupt and immoral.

Coming in like a landslide
Fast and hard as I can
I want blood, mud and poison
'Cause that's the nature of man

So put your cape and your gloves on
Climb on top of your roof
Some kind of hero
Saving me from you

I will destroy this place if I have to
Knocking up against the walls of the bathroom
I will destroy this place if I have to
Slamming up against the walls of the bathroom

Banging on your atom shell
Bang banging on your atom shell
Banging on your atom shell
Bang banging on your atom shell

So drag me across the pavement
And tie my legs and hands
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/atom-shell.html]
Spitting blood, mud and poison
'Cause it's what I am

So put your gloves and your cape on
And your mask and your boots
Begging for your hero
But no-one's saving you

I will destroy this place if I have to
Knocking up against the walls of the bathroom
I will destroy this place if I have to
Slamming up against the walls of the bathroom
I will destroy this place if I have to
Knocking up against the walls of the bathroom
I will destroy this place if I have to
Slamming up against the walls of the bathroom

Banging on your atom shell
Bang banging on your atom shell
Banging on your atom shell
Bang banging on your atom shell
Banging on your atom shell
Bang banging on your atom shell....!
Banging on your atom shell
Bang banging on your atom shell
