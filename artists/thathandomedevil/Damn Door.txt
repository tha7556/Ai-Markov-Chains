[Spoken:] (And here he is, the star of our show, direct from the bar.)

Baby girl, what'd you say?
I'll kick this damn door down

Love is a grudge that I won't hold you to
Uncontrollable, it'll roll right over you
Don't pull me into your little world
I'm doin' fine right here
Check the driver's-side mirror
It's closer than it might appear

My heroes OD'd, robbed banks and killed themselves
Lyin' on the floor with their insides spillin' out

Baby, wait, baby girl, what'd you say? Oh, no
I'll kick this damn door down
I'll kick this damn door down

I'm comin' down with the shakes
My heart is poundin' away
Da-boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
I'm knockin' others awake
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/damn-door.html]
With the sound that it makes
A-boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
I'm burning out the mistakes
My foot is poundin' the brakes
A-boom-boom-boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
I'm gonna drown on the way
With the sound that it makes
A-boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

My heroes OD'd, robbed banks and killed themselves
Lyin' on the floor with their insides spillin' out

I'll kick this damn door down
I'll kick this damn door down

My heroes OD'd, robbed banks and killed themselves
Lyin' on the floor with their insides spillin' out

Wait a minute baby, baby, wait
What? Come on
I'll kick this damn door down
I'll kick this damn door down
I'll kick this damn door down
(I'll kick this damn door down)
