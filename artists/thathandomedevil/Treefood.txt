Waves will eat the world, leave nothing but the bone
The flesh will grow back, the people will go
Enter golden sun, opening flowers
Drinking from ponds, hanging around

I don't mind the sun in my eyes
The smell of the sweat
The buzz of the flies
Death comes alive
Death coming to life

Scared and alone, holding in close
And I'll hold her tighter when she gets old
Fluffing our pillows, washing our clothes
Eating our dinner, watching our shows

I don't mind the sun in my eyes
The smell of the rye
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/treefood.html]
The buzz of the flies
Death comes alive
Death coming to life

I don't mind the sun in my eyes
The smell of the sweat
The buzz of the flies
Death comes alive
Death coming tonight

The room fills with water
And I'm floating inside
I'll be all right
I'll be all right

Lungs fill with water
But I'm smiling inside
I'll be all right
I'll be all right
