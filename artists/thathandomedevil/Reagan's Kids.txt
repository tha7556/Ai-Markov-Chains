Hangin' on the wall,
Draggin' on the floor
Outside of West Central Park
Right where Lennon was shot

Taggin' on the wall,
Hangin' on the floor
Gut twisted up in a knot
Right where Lennon was shot

The hippies all had scattered off
To work their jobs at Microsoft
The love had died, the war was lost
And no one really cared enough

Clothes, hoes, and cash
The kids that Reagan had
Goin' out with a blast
The kids that Reagan had

Flower children had their children
The world went up another billion
God save these babies of the 80's

Politicians, politicin'
And everybody makes a killin'
God save these babies of the 80's

Clothes, hoes, and cash
The kids that Reagan had
The nation of no dads
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/reagans-kids.html]
The kids that Reagan had

The hippies all had scattered off
To work their jobs at Microsoft
The love had died, the war was lost
And no one really cared enough

The hippies all had scattered off
For hackey-sack and frisbee golf
The love had died, the war was lost
And no one really said too much

Hangin' on the wall
Draggin' on the floor
Outside of West Central Park
Right where Lennon was shot

Taggin' on the wall
Hangin' on the floor
Gut twisted up in a knot
Right where Lennon was shot

Hangin' on the wall
Draggin' on the floor
Outside of West Central Park
Right where Lennon was shot

Taggin' on the wall
Hangin' on the floor
Gut twisted up in a knot
Right where Lennon was shot
