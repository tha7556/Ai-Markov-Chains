Ugh

Lucy's a goth chick
Spit in the face of a jock at the mosh pit
Then the kid lost it
Saw her at the mall at the local Hot Topic
Her boyfriend was pickin' out a new chain wallet

Lucy's all talk
She really ain't got no heart for a fight
She'd rather see an art show
Beat her face down 'till she looked like a Picasso
Even ripped the ring out her boyfriend's nostril

Brother's outside
Smokin' on a Newport
Heard about his sister
Runnin' through the food court
Ran right over the dude from the shoe store
Rumored that he jumped down two floors, ooh Lord

Came right up behind him
The kid didn't see him
I've never seen that look
On another human bein'

Bats in the belfry (Woo-ha)
Rotten on the vine (Ha-ha, ha, ha)
Can't keep my eye's closed (Woo-ha)
Sunny all the time (Ha, ha)
Put your hands where I can see 'em boy
Keep 'em up high
This place (this place) has gone (has gone, gone, gone) crazy

Mona from Sedona, Arizona
Drove to California in a beat up Toyota
Readin' Deepak Chopra
And singin' " Champaign Supernova"

Life it ain't all roses
Though you go where you're supposed to go
Woke up in a mobile home
Kidney sold in Tokyo

Jumpin' out the double wide
Runnin' through the trailer park
Tearin' off her duct tape
Wearin' just a pair of socks
Terry-cloth undies that her parents bought
In hysterics when the sheriff stopped
Cryin' with her hair in knots
Smellin' like Smirnoff
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/viva-discordia.html]
I think the drugs are wearin' off

Bats in the belfry (Woo-ha)
Rotten on the vine (Ha-ha, ha, ha)
Can't keep my eye's closed (Woo-ha)
Sunny all the time (Ha, ha)
Put your hands where I can see 'em boy
Keep 'em up high
This place (this place) has gone (has gone, gone, gone) crazy

[Break]

It don't matter, matter
Climb that ladder
Da-da, da, da, da-da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Matter and matter, matter
Climbin' that ladder
Da-da, da, da, da-da, da, da, da-da-da-da

It don't matter, matter
Climb that ladder
Da-da, da, da, da-da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Matter and matter, matter
Climbin' that ladder
Da-da, da, da, da-da, da, da

Woo-ha

Daddy's little president
Never found the evidence
Heaven sent lemon-scented
Medicine they fed us with

Said the speech
Read it off the teleprompter
Fly away
In an Army helicopter

Heavy metal concert
In the yellow Mazda
Jello shots and marijuana
Going off to war now
For a bunch of mobsters
Looking for Osama Bin La da, da, da, da, da, da, da

Bats in the belfry (Woo-ha)
Rotten on the vine (Ha-ha, ha, ha)
Can't keep my eye's closed (Woo-ha)
Sunny all the time (Ha, ha)
Put your hands where I can see 'em boy
Keep 'em up high
This place (this place) - has gone (has gone, gone, gone) - crazy
