At night in the darkest
Part of my apartment
(La-dee-da-dee-da)
Just sitting on the carpet

No (lights) in my apartment
Digging through the garbage
(La-dee-da-dee-da)
P-P-P-Pretty please,I promise

Toss over the TV
Knock over the CDs
Bouncin' off the ceilin'
Papa do you see me?

Shootin' out the TV
Stompin' on the CDs
Hangin' from the ceilin'
Mama do you see me?

There is no magic
Just a charming little lie
It's gonna make you cry
Cry, cry-cry, cry

Remember you were young
When you cared about shit (cared about shit)
You just got older like the rest all did (rest all did)

Remember you were young
When you cared about shit (cared about shit)
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/cry.html]
You just got older like the rest all did (rest all did)

We lost the magic now
Its charming little lies
I wanna make you cry
Cry, cry-cry, cry

[Break]

At night in the darkest
Part of my apartment
(La-dee-da-dee-da)
Just sitting on the carpet

No (lights) in my apartment
Digging through the garbage
(La-dee-da-dee-da)
This is sounding like nonsense

Remember you were young
When you cared about shit (cared about shit)
You just got older like the rest all did

Remember you were young
When you cared about shit (cared about shit)
You just got older like the rest all did

There is no magic
Just a charming little lie
It's gonna make you cry
Cry, cry-cry, cry
I wanna make you cry
