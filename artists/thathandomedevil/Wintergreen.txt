Her face had a run-in with a fist
Or a steering wheel
You could hear her coming
From the click of her plastic heels

Insides have died and you're just standing here
Behind your eyes there's no one anywhere

Sleepin' on a subway
City up above me
Dreamin' up the words to this song
Bettin' on a someday
Wakin' up at someplace
Believe me, baby, I know

It holds you tight then it lets you go
Didn't looked back, just left it alone
Grabbed my coat, my hat
Let the train take me home

Sleepin' on a subway
City up above me
Runnin' since the day I was born
Bettin' on a someday
Wakin' up at someplace
Believe me, baby, I know

Howlin' at me tellin' me she's sick
And she needs some help
Old woman suckin' on a dick
For a dollar bill
Insides have died and you're just standing here
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/wintergreen.html]
Behind your eyes there's no one anywhere

Sleepin' on a subway
City up above me
Dreamin' up the words to this song
Bettin' on a someday
Wakin' up at someplace
Believe me, baby, I know

It's that little piece of nothin' that won't let you go
Didn't looked back, just left it alone
Grab my coat and my hat
Let the train take me home

Sleepin' on a subway
City up above me
Runnin' since the day I was born
Bettin' on a someday
Wakin' up at someplace
Believe me, baby, I know

The living under bridges thing
Where I was only visiting
Where ladies drink the Listerine
To keep their livers clean
And wintergreen

The living under bridges thing
Where I was only visiting
Where ladies drink the Listerine
To keep their livers clean
And wintergreen
