The star has died before the wisemen followed it's light
I move myself around so rats know I'm alive
It grows around me sprouting, dies and grows again
Batton down the hatches kids, the storm is rolling in

Give them too much food
They eat themselves to death
Now you're in the loop
Wound to your hanging web
You need to leave it alone
C'mon and let them be loud
Oh nostalgia powderbomb
Death won't stop you anymore
Attention whore, attention whore
Death won't stop you anymore
Attention whore, attention whore

The day don't greet me nicely, the creaking of the bone
But everything will go away if you leave it alone
Give them too much food
They eat themselves to death
Now you're in the loop
Wound to your hanging web
You need to leave it alone
C'mon and let them be loud
Oh nostalgia Powderbomb

Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick boom!
Tick tick tick tock
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/powderbomb.html]
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick boom!
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick boom!
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick tock
Tick tick tick boom!
(Death won't stop you anymore, attention whore, attention whore)

That's all right, that's okay
We don't want it anyway
Boom boom bang bang boom boom hey hey!

It's alright it's okay
We don't like you anyway
Boom boom bang bang boom boom hey hey!

Give them too much food,
They eat themselves to death
Now you're in the loop
Wound to your hanging web

Give them too much food
They eat themselves to death
Now you're in the loop
Wound to your hanging web
You need to leave it alone
C'mon and let them be loud
Oh nostalgia Powderbomb
