Uh, four score and seven beers ago, uh-huh

Uh, sittin' on the front stoop, wonderin' what we gonna do?
What the world come to, who you gonna run to?
Another year older and deeper in debt
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent
You pay those bills, and you get that rent
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent

Fillin' up the backpack, back in the Cadillac
Rollin' down to D.C. to get my money back
Oh man, this is awesome, a-loadin' up a shotgun
A-bury me in cash in a big black coffin
A-runnin' through the White House, mask on, lights out
In the Oval Office like, "Empty yo' pockets"
Stickin' up Congress, purses, watches

Well, I ain't seen green since I don't know when
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent
I don't make no money, don't make no sense
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent
You gotta pay those bills, you gotta get that rent
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent
Another year older and deeper in debt
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent

Walk through the doorway, lookin' so cool
Chrome six-shooter, feelin' old school
Walk through the doorway, feelin' old school
Chrome six-shooter, lookin' so cool
Get on the flo' and gimme yo' loot
Come on mo-fo', I ain't scared to shoot

I bet ya won't catch me, man, Fox News, C-Span
Back-to-back broadcasts, shows all weekend
Can't catch me, man, Fox News, C-Span
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/rob-the-prez-o-dent.html]
Back-to-back broadcasts, shows all weekend
I say you won't catch me, man, Fox News, C-Span
Back-to-back broadcasts, shows all weekend
Bugged-out burglarin', hurdle Secret Service men

Well, I ain't seen green since I don't know when
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent
I don't make no money, don't make no sense
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent
You gotta pay those bills, you gotta get that rent
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent
Another year older and deeper in debt
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent

Well, I ain't seen green since I don't know when
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent
Don't make no money, don't make no sense
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent

It's nothing symbolic like burning the flag
Just put all your wallets into the bag
You've robbed me for years, and I want it all back
And that, and that
And that, and that, and that, and that

Runnin' through the White House, mask on, lights out
In the Oval Office like, "Empty yo' pockets"
Stickin' up Congress, purses, watches
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent

Oh, man, this is awesome, loadin' up a shotgun
Bury me in cash in a big black coffin
Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Shoot 'em when the cops come
I'm gonna rob the Prez-O-Dent

Like all too many of his contemporaries, Tom is experimenting with something he knows little about. He experiences an uncontrollable feeling of hilarity. Quite without reason he exhibits a marked carelessness. His senses and time perception are distorted. He becomes confused, and he displays the induced "couldn't care less" attitude.
