Malory used to wear flowery clothes
Hobnobbin' with the snobs at the gallery shows
Now, I know what you doin' when you powder your nose
I could've done somethin' lookin' back, I suppose

Here come Jimmy, way too skinny
Down one forty from about two fifty
Hangin' out on the wrong side of the city
I used to have pity now I don't have any

Standin' on the corner in the cloth tube top
Bleach blond hair and a botched boob job
Hollywood Holly say she'll top you off, but
That's the kind of talk, girl, that got you shot

Say (Oh)
I ain't workin' no more
C'mon now (Hey)
I wanna sleep all day
And the song goes (Oh)
We can't take it no more
Don't worry 'bout it, man (Ha, ha)
There's pills for everything

Brimstone fire and new gold chains
Cigarette lighters and cook cocaine
There's pills for everything
Brimstone fire and new gold chains
Cigarette lighters and cook cocaine
There's pills for everything

I wanna get up
I wanna get down
I wanna feel so good so bad
I don't want it around

I need to get up
I need to be free
I need to feel so good so bad
I need to believe

Say (Oh)
I ain't workin' no more
C'mon now (Hey)
I wanna sleep all day
And the song goes (Oh)
We can't take it no more (Hoo)
Don't worry 'bout it, man (Ha, ha)
There's pills for everything

Sleepin' on the futon
Alligator boots on
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/that-handsome-devil/a-city-dressed-in-dynamite/pills-for-everything.html]
Waitin' for a friend of mine
Some they never move on
Wait around too long
End up left behind

Sleepin' on the futon
Alligator boots on
Waitin' for a friend of mine
Some they never move on
Wait around too long
End up left behind

Sleepin' on the futon
Alligator boots on
Waitin' for a friend of mine
Some they never move on
Wait around too long
End up left behind

I wanna get up
I wanna get down
I wanna feel so good so bad
I don't want it around

I need to get up
I need to be free
I need to get them god-damn pills
Far away from me

Oh, come on and say (Oh)
I ain't workin' no more
And the song goes (Hey)
I wanna sleep all day
Say (Oh)
We can't take it no more (Hoo)
Don't worry 'bout it man (Ha, ha)
There's pills for everything

Brimstone fire and new gold chains
Cigarette lighters and cook cocaine
Brimstone fire and new gold chains
Cigarette lighters and cook cocaine
Brimstone fire and new gold chains
Cigarette lighters and cook cocaine
Brimstone fire and new gold chains
Cigarette lighters and cook cocaine

(Please, that hurts, don't do it any more!)
(Are you gonna be on my side if I let ya up?)
(Sure, I'm on your side. Just let me up; I'll do anything you say.)
(You're on my side.)
(I'm on your side.)
(Okay, lets go find the other fellas.)
